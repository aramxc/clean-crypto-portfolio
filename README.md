# Clean Crypto Portfolio

## [View App on Github Pages Here](https://aramxc.github.io/clean-crypto-portfolio/)

Project goal: design and implement a fully functional react application that pulls data from Coin Market Cap's free tier API service ([see documentation here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/)). Users will input their crypto holdings and be able to see in real time their total portfolio value along with 1H, 24H, and 7D changes for each symbol.

Currently rewriting backend in Go to make it more efficient and scalable.

Eventually I would like to add alerting and additional features as I build this up..
