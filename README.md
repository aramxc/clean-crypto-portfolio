# Clean Crypto Portfolio

## In Development as of 07/27/24! Check back soon..

Project goal: design and implement a fully functional react application that pulls data from Coin Market Cap's free tier API service ([see documentation here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/)). Users will input their crypto holdings and be able to see in real time their total portfolio value along with 1H, 24H, and 7D changes for each symbol.

Eventually I would like to add alerting and additional features as I build this up..
